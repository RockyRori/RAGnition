Degree Classification  Minimum Cumulative G. P. A. Required  
Distinction  3. 50 
Pass 2. 67 
 
2. 10. 2  These classifications are given according to the student's Cumulative G.

--- Segment 36 ---
2  These classifications are given according to the student's Cumulative G. P. A. 2. 11. Intermediate Award  
 
2. 11. 1  Students will be awarded a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science ((數據科學深造
文憑) if they complete any four required courses with a minimum Cumulative GPA 
of 2. 33. 2. 11. 2  Acceptance of an intermediate award implies an intention not to complete the final 
award. Where students seek re -admission to complete the award, readmission cannot 
be guaranteed. Where students are readmitted and go on to complete the award, their 
transcr ipts will indicate that the intermediate award has been superseded.

--- Segment 37 ---
Where students are readmitted and go on to complete the award, their 
transcr ipts will indicate that the intermediate award has been superseded. 2. 12. Degree Conferment Date  
 
Awards of this programme will be conferred on 31 March, 31 August or 15 November in 
each academic year. Students shall be invited to indicate their preferred degree conferment 
date. 2. 13. Early Alert System  
 
To enhance support for a student with potential study problems, the Programme Curriculum 
Committee (PCC) of the programme will give an early warning/advice to the student or may 
10 
 have a special consideration for the student's chance of study continuation, which depends 
on the conditions specified below.

--- Segment 38 ---
Early Alert System  
 
To enhance support for a student with potential study problems, the Programme Curriculum 
Committee (PCC) of the programme will give an early warning/advice to the student or may 
10 
 have a special consideration for the student's chance of study continuation, which depends 
on the conditions specified below. • If a student's Cumulative G. P. A. is equal to or greater than 2. 50 but smaller than 2. 67, 
then the PCC of the MSc DS Programme will give an early warning/advice to the 
student. • If a student's Cumulative G. P. A. is smaller than 2. 50 but equal to or greater than 2. 33 
(equivalent to "C+"), then the PCC of the MSc DS Programme may have a special 
consideration for the student's chance of study continuation.

--- Segment 39 ---
33 
(equivalent to "C+"), then the PCC of the MSc DS Programme may have a special 
consideration for the student's chance of study continuation. Here, the cumulative 
G. P. A. of 2. 33 is regarded as the minimum Cumulative G. P. A. threshold for special consideration for a chance of continuation. • If the student satisfies the Cumulative G. P. A. requirement for special consideration, 
then the student can apply for an interview to be conducted by the Programme Director , 
who will closely consider the student's eligibility for continuation and then report their recommendation to the Board of Examiners for the MSc DS Programme. The Board of 
Examiners will make a decision on the marginal case and report their thinking and decision to the University's Postgraduate Studies Committee (PSC) for information, or make recommendations on the marginal case for special consideration by the PSC for 
a chance of continuation. If approved by the PSC, the student who is given a chance of continuation will be put on academic probation in the following term, the academic 
probation will be lifted if he/she obtains a cumulative GPA of 2.

--- Segment 40 ---
If approved by the PSC, the student who is given a chance of continuation will be put on academic probation in the following term, the academic 
probation will be lifted if he/she obtains a cumulative GPA of 2. 5 or above. 2. 14. Scholarships  
 
Scholarships might be considered for outstanding students on the basis of academic merit. All students admitted to the programme  will automatically be the candidates for the 
scholarships. No application is required . 2. 15. Official Communication Channel
