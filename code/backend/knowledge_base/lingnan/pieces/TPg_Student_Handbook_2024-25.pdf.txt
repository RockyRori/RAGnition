OBATL requires that assessment processes be based on clearly expressed criteria which are then used for determining the final grade (criterion -referencing). In other words, students are graded on the basis of attaining well defined learning outcomes (i. e. , knowledge, skills, attributes criteria) rather than how they compare with their peer group (norm -referencing).
