## Global Exposure for Students

About **85%** of our undergraduates go on exchange or participate in summer programmes to widen their horizons and experience different cultures.

A major objective of Lingnan's education is to provide students with **international exposure** and to broaden their global outlook. This international dimension aims to strengthen students’ learning environment through diversity, enrich it via cross-cultural interaction and exchange, and provide both **academic knowledge** and **extra-curricular learning experiences** from various cultures.

## Global Exchange Experience

To date, we have agreements with over **270 partner institutions** worldwide, covering Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, and the Americas.

Before the COVID-19 global pandemic, about **80%** of our undergraduates went on exchange for a term or attended summer or winter programmes.

A variety of **scholarships** are available to both local and non-local undergraduates.
